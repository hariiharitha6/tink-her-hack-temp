# LUNARA – Smart Maternal Care & Emergency Monitoring System 🎯

## Basic Details

### Team Name:CodebreakerZ

- Member 1: Afreen Yusaf- ASET
- Member 2: D Haritha - ASET

### Hosted Project Link

### Project Description
LUNARA is a smart maternal healthcare monitoring system designed for rural women and ASHA workers.
It tracks pregnancy health parameters, predicts risk levels, and enables real-time emergency alerts with sound notifications to healthcare workers.


### The Problem statement

In rural areas:

Pregnant women lack continuous health monitoring

ASHA workers cannot track high-risk cases in real time

Emergency alerts are delayed

No centralized dashboard exists for maternal risk tracking


This delay can cost lives.
### The Solution
LUNARA provides:

✔ Health tracking (BP, Sugar, Hemoglobin, Weight)
✔ Smart AI-based Pregnancy Risk Score (0–100)
✔ Real-time Firebase emergency alerts
✔ Admin (ASHA worker) dashboard with live alert sound
✔ Data visualization using graphs
✔ Trimester & due date tracking

This creates a mini smart maternal monitoring ecosystem.
